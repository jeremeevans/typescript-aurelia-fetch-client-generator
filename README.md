# A TypeScript aurelia-fetch-client generator for Swagger Codegen

This generator assumes you are using [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) and the [aurelia-fetch-client](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/fetch-client/latest/http-services/2) to develop some pretty neat stuff. That being said, the TypeScript code generated by this generator is meant to be directly referenced by your application. It should already have your aurelia-fetch-client configured, and your polyfills in place.
